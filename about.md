This site is generated by [GitHub Pages][pages] from my `vzome-sharing` [source repository][source].
In addition, much of the content in that repo is generated by [vZome][vzome], a desktop app
for designing geometric shapes, with specific support for shapes that can be constructed with
[Zometool][zometool].  With vZome, any design can be shared as a page, if you have a `vzome-sharing`
GitHub repository and you've followed the [configuration instructions][help].

Once vZome has uploaded a design and a generated page source, you can further customize
the page, adding additional text, images, and interactive 3d `vzome-viewer` elements if you want
more designs on your page.  See some of the posts on this site to get an idea of the possibilities.
