## Your vZome design is uploaded

### [vZome Online view][embed]

***This is the best link to share***!  The link is *embeddable* because it will render in social media (e.g. Discord, Twitter, FaceBook...) with a proper title and a preview image.

### [Raw vZome file][raw]

This is just the link to the raw vZome file, and is **not** good for
sharing on social media.
Honestly, you probably don't want this, though it could be used from either
vZome desktop ("Open URL...") or vZome Online ("Remote vZome URL").
