This shows a sequence of 120-hedra that can be seen as a transformation.  This part of the full sequence is between an Enneacontahedron and a stellation of a Triacontahedron, shown as a composite of polyhedra edge frames, sharing 3-fold vertices. Scenes shows the transition from one to the next. While this transformation is understood to be continuous, here we only show examples that can be readily constructed with vZome.  

vZome users note that this sequence uses strut directions from the hypotenuse leg of the Build Triangle.
