A roof model composed of 4 selections cut from hyperbolic paraboloids. Each selection is an
“eyebrow” form. The 4 straight planar elements that meet at the apex can be seen as hip
rafters for their top half that transition to valley rafters for their bottom half. These 4 curved
surfaces are doubly ruled—i.e., two straight lines lying on each surface intersect at every point
on the surface. Sheathing material can be adapted to follow the straight lines shown.
