A lattice combining BCC (Yellow strut) and FCC, or Oct-Tet (Green strut) lattices.  Plane elements are squares, rhombi, equilateral triangles , and hexagons.  Polyhedra are 28-hedra, with a bridgework of truncated tetrahedra, hexagonal prisms, rhombic and triangular prisms.  Overall symmetry is tetrahedral.  One truncated tetrahedron in the center of the array has yellow faces, for visibility.  All other panels are on square faces.  In this model, lengths of yellow and green struts are adjusted to an equal length, so this array can be called regular.

Another Hybrid array, with yellow and green struts.  In this model, the lengths have not been adjusted to be equal, but are standard for Octahedral Symmetry in Zome system.  This can be seen as an array of Rhombic Dodecahedra with a network of Octahedra and Tetrahedra between them.  Panelling only rectangles with yellow and green edges leaves two sets of tunnels that connect the RDs to each other, and the Oct-Tet network separately.

Adjusting lengths to a different ratio, this is a sample of an Oct-Tet lattice with separation between it's polyhedra by bands of struts that are parallel with edges of Rhombic Dodecahedra.
