  Several compositions and frameworks using modules of three pairs of parallel commponents. The first is a representation of a six strut [Tensegrity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tensegrity) with blue struts representing tension members, and purple struts as compression members

In this model, the six struts are shown as heart lines of square prisms, sized to meet adjacent prisms.  The tension elements can be grouped and effectively replaced with other kinds of coupling, such as adhesive or fasteners.

In this configuration, the prism components can be proportioned in many ways.  Here is shown two, one with 1x2 cross section, the other with 2x1.  In both cases, the lengths (l) are adjusted to be i width (w) + 2 thicknesses (t)

These components, or sticks, can be proportioned for particular effects. Here, sticks with 1x√2 x-section are cut at 45°, son as to delineate a Rhombicuboctahedron.  The pieces can be connected with imbedded magnets, or glued, leaving  one removeable, as shown.

Another proportioning and cutting of sticks is shown [Here](http://www.kosticks.com/triacontahedron-box.html)

Other ways in which these six piece modules can be used is as connections between beams in a framework.  The concept is, theses pieces form a primary structure, they can have continuity beyond the intersection zone.  There can then be a secondary set of parts that infill between the primary pieces, either inline with beam direction, or as diagonal bracing.  Here is an example of an I-beam construction made from standard sizes of wood.

Here is a frame built with beams having cross section as a cross, or a plus sign.  Infill pieces are shown as a lighter shade.  I once was involved with building out a loft space in NYC,and made a step wall like this as a partition separating a entry/display space from work places.  The beams were pre-fabricated individsually, and then assembled.  Panels and/or fabric was fitted into the frame.
