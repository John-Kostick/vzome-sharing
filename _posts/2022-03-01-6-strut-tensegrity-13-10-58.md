  A series of related models and images showing transformations of edges of polyhedra. These kinds of transformative re-orientations of edges of Platonic Solids and other polyhedra can be done in [Tensegrity] models, but can also be done with compression elements in contact with adjacent elements.  The theme is, edge oriented struts can be rotated about a radial axis and moved in or out on that axis to make other configurations, such as triagles, and parallel groupings aligned with axial symmetries.  This can be called an inversion.  In this model of a [Tensegrity] the blue struts represent tension elements, and the black struts represent compression elements, which are in 3 groups of 2 parallels oriented to x,y,and z axes.

[Tensegrity}(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tensegrity)

In this model, edges of a Tetrahedron are shown rotating about their midpoints through a sequence of skew positions to the parallel condition as shown above.  This is only one sequence, as the rotation can continue through to the Tetrahedron in opposite orientation, the dual of the first one. In Desktop vZome, titled bookmarks show the full sequence of positions in order, top to bottom. Struts are spaced apart, as they would be in a Tensegrity, but tensi on elements are not shown.

This shows the transformation with edge struts maintaining contact with adjacents through the full sequence.
