  A series of related models and images showing transformations of edges of polyhedra. These kinds of transformative re-orientations of edges of Platonic Solids and other polyhedra can be done in Tensegrity models, but can also be done with compression elements in contact with adjacent elements.  The theme is, edge oriented struts can be rotated about a radial axis and moved in or out on that axis to make other configurations, such as triagles, and parallel groupings aligned with axial symmetries.  This can be called an inversion.
