Here are shown some explorations of 14-directional figures.  These are all based on polar symmetry, such as constructed from a pyramid with a regular 14-gon base plane.  The first model is of a cluster of 7 armed spirallohedra.

Note that the pair of spirallohrdra centered along the polar axis are conected to the ring of seven units that nest into each other, but only minimally, with rhombi. This connecting bridgework can be extended with planes and polyhedra composed of unit edge lengths parallel with some of the 14 directions, but it is a complicated pattern. 

Another configuration of seven armed spirallohedra can be viewed [Here](https://skfb.ly/oAQDI)

Here is shown a pair of 14 directional polar zonohedra, (182 faces) with a "collar" of hexahedral and dodecahedral cells connecting them.  The feature of twin zonal loops is colored red and green.  Note that while both loops share parallel edges, they are distinct, they do not overlap,
