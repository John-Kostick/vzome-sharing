This shows a sequence of 120-hedra that can be seen as a transformation. This part of the full sequence is between a stellation of a Triacontahedron and a Stellated Icosahedron. shown as a composite of polyhedra edge frames, sharing 3-fold vertices. Scenes shows the transition from one to the next. While this transformation is understood to be continuous, here we only show examples that can be readily costructed with vZome.  

vZome users note that this sequence uses strut directions from the long leg of the Build Triangle

This is a continuation of [120 Hedra Part 2](https://john-kostick.github.io/vzome-sharing/2024/03/27/120-Hedra-Part-2-13-05-14.html)
