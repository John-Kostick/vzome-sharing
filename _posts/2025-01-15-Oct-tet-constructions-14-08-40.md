Here are shown examples of polyhedra built with tubular edges.  This is a continuation of [Tubular Zonohedra Constructions](https://john-kostick.github.io/vzome-sharing/2025/01/16/Tubular-Zonohedra-Constructions-3-07-49-58.html)  In this part of the series, the polyhedra are built with struts in Oct-Tet system, (vZome green lines.)  Scenes includes several examples.  As with the first part of the series, a scaled down polyhedron is used as a "hub." In this case, the polyhedron is a Cuboctahedron.  The faces of these hub cuboctahedra are extended to build tubular struts surrounding heartlines.  In these Oct-Tet models, the tubular struts have cross-sectional profiles that are irregular hexagonal.  Struts, or sticks with this profile, can be used to compose, in addition to the polyhedra shown, frameworks of other configurations such as Trefoil knots, and Triamond Lattice samples.  The method used here of building with panels can produce 3D printable models, and can be useful in designing parts for fabrication, such as wood pieces with mitre cuts for joinery.

In this part of the series, the polyhedra shown in Scenes are all composed of struts drawn from 15-directional (vZome blue line) system. The scaled down polyhedron used as a "hub" is an Icosidodecahedron. Planes extending from faces of these hubs form tubular struts with irregular decagonal cross-section.  As with the Oct-Tet models, in addition to regular polyhedra, struts with this profile can be applied to any configuration made from lines in this system.  One such example shown in Scenes is a Stellated Dodecahedron.
