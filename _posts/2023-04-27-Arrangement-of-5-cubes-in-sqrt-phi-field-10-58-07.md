 This shows five cubes arranged about a common center.  They are rotated 72° apart about a line, which is the polar axis of a Rhombic Icosahedron.  This is built in √𝜑 field,and has 10 square faces and 10 arc tan √𝜑 = 51.827...° rhombi. Scenes shows 10 cubes external to the square faces, and surrounding the intersection of 5 cubes.
