  A group of six-armed rhombic spirallohedra nested together. These polyhedra are packed together in hexagonally symmetric layers.  Between layers there are unfilled spaces.  This packing configuration resembles close packing of spheres, where there are hexagonally symmetric layers stacked in varied patterns, such as hexagonal close packed, HCP, and Face centered cubic, FCC.  This is more like FCC, but with different positioning of cells in layers relative to layers "above" and "below."  Possibly, there could be other packing arrangements, more like HCP.

This shows a sample of the unfilled spaces between layers of polyhedra.
