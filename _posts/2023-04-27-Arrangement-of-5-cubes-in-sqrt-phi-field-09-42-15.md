This shows five cubes arranged about a common center. They are rotated about a line which is the polar axis of a Rhombic Icosdahedron.  This is built in √𝜑 field, so the faces of the Rhombic Icosa are squares and Arc Tan √𝜑 = 51.827...° rhombi.  Cubes are aligned with square faces. Scenes shows 10 cubes external to RI, and surrounding intersection.
