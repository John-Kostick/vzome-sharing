  Dissection of a seven directional polar zonohedron by reduction.  Zones are successively reduced to zero.  Reducing purple zone leaves an eccentric rhombic Triacontahedron.  Reducing blue zone leaves an eccentric rhombic Icosahedron.  Reducing green zone leaves a dodecahedron, and reducing yellow zone leaves. a hexahedron. In this dissection, there are four types of hexahedron.
