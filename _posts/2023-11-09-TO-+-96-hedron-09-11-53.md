 This exploration is a continuation of a study of polyhedra that can represent [Close-packing of equal spheres](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Close-packing_of_equal_spheres) 
Part 1 of this study can be seen [Here](https://john-kostick.github.io/vzome-sharing/2022/05/19/Octagonal-Trackball-FCCvZome-18-55-02.html) 
Here, a regular Truncated Octahedron has a polyhedron inscribed in it that can be seen as representing a sphere, as its' vertices are all equidistant from the center, and the midpoints of the eges of the TO are all on the sphere surface

vZome users; Note that this 96-hedron has all the points indicating strut directions that appear on the √2 field trackball, with an additional set at the midpoints of edges of the TO that make squares.

For simplicity of rendering, we can look at just the Truncated Octahedron that can have a shere inscibed within it, and compose arrays.

Rather than the familiar "Honeycomb" space-filling array of TO cells that share faces with adjacent cells, one can construct arrays of parallel TOs that are connected to adjacents by shared edges. Here, such an array is configured to indicate FCC close packing. Note that all the spaces between cells can be filled with a combination of Cuboctahedra and Truncated Tetrahedra, thus all edges are taken from an Oct-Tet lattice.

Here, an array of edge-connected TO cells is configured to indicate HCP close packing.  Note that in this array, some of the spaces between cells can
 be filled with half coboctahedra, and some with Truncated Octahedra in pairs that share a hexagonal face. all taken from Oct-Tet lattice. Note also that in this array, there is only one axis of 3-fold symmetry, corresponding to the "up direction in a stack of spheres, such as cannon balls. Hence, Hexagonal Close Packing.

If gravity is disregarded, and cells are considered to be able to bond to adjacents at points of contact in the array, i.e. midpoints of TO edges, it is possible to construct an array with HCP pattern, but in all 4 axes of 3-fold symmetry. This results in a less dense packing than the  
close packed arrays.

Extending this less dense array further leads to this chiral pattern.  This too is all drawn from Oct-Tet lattice.
