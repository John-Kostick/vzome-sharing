  Various ways that domes can be constructed. [Geodesic Domes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geodesic_dome) are mostly defined and/or built with icosahedral symmetry. like this.

 However, by a broader definiotion of [geodesic](https://www.lexico.com/en/definition/geodesic), octahedral symmetry is valid.  Given that anything constructed of straight line edges and flat panels can have all vertices lying on a spherical or other curving surface, this model is geodesic in octahedral symmetry, which is to say, arcs passing through sets of vertices that, in this case, are equidistant from a center point meet the definition.

Many domes have been built throughout history, with spherical form, typically with a polar axis, similar to this.

While many are grand scale, construction of smaller scale domed roofs has been widely practiced since antiquity.  This is a parabolic form, with the portions of the curve that intersect the cube frame representing outlines of squinches, or structures that carry support from walls to the circular base  of the dome.  Notably, [Hassan Fathy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hassan_Fathy) used traditional mud block construction of domes and vaulted roofs.

Geodesic domes are certainly impressive and inspiring.  In my explorations of them, though, I became aware of some of the limitations and disadvantages of their application for habition.  In this [article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geodesic_dome), there is a critique of these limitations, which I find accurate.  I would add, though, that one apect that can address some of the issues mentioned is orientation.  Many domes I have seen are oriented with a fivefold axis as vertical.  By orienting with a 2-fold axis as vertical, it becomes easier to integrate  with more standard xyz coordinated structures and plans, and more natural to inhabit.  We do, after all, have an anatomy that is 2-fold, or bilateral, with paired hands, eyes, etc.  This model is an example of how a geodesic form could be adjoined with a typical kind of building that accomodates partitioning for amenites, utility spaces, etc., and allows for window placement to be more standard.  This particular interior surface of the dome allows for insulation, wiring, etc.
