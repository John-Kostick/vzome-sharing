These are models of trefoil knot tables. The designs are credited to [Koos Verhoeff](https://www.google.com/search?client=safari&rls=en&q=koos+verhoeff&ie=UTF-8&oe=UTF-8)

In both of these designs, there is an ingenious use of rectangular cross-section sticks with a proportion of 1/√2.  Cutting these at a 45° mitre yields square faces that can be joined to successive sticks at 90° or at 120°, thus building chains,  When these pieces are sized properly, their centerlines coincide with the lines of paths in an Oct-Tet lattice, such as trefoil knots.  The first one has 18 pieces, and the second is 2 tiered, with 24 pieces.  This has an especially interesting feature, which is a Mobius twist.  On Desktop, one can select successive panels to "walk around" this path.

These have been built as table bases by [Jane Kostick](http://www.kosticks.com/koos-verhoeff.html)

This is the 24 piece one as a table base.
