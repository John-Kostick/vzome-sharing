 Some unconventional hyperboloids. Using a graphical technique, hyperboloids can be generated in various symmetries. This first is in Octahedral symmetery, and indicates surfaces that are defined by x*y*z=constant.  This is not a conventional hyperboloid of revolution. Here, the z,y,z axes are asymptotes.

This shows a 2-D grid, which has intervals on the series 1,1/𝝋 ,1/𝝋^2,... The grid is formed by determining the limit of the series.  This is found to be 2+1/𝝋 . Working from the top right, it can be shown that for each indicated curve, all grid points are solutions to equations of the form X * Y = constant, an alternate definition of hyperbola. Using copies of this grid in all xy, xz, and yz planes, a 3D grid is formed, which is how the hyperboloids above are constructed.

This graphical method can be applied with other series' and in different angular systems.  Here, a series with intervals of the form 1, 1/a, 1/a^2, ...  where a= √2 with the limit of the series being  2+√2 generates hyperbolas on a grid.  In this example, the grid  axes  are not mutually orthogonal, but at arc cosine 1/3 = 70.528...°. the BCC angle.

This method can be applied to other angular systems, such as Oct-Tet, with 60°between grid lines.
