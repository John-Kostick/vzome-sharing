  An array of Rhombic Dodecahedra with zones of different lengths. Rhombic Dodecahedra are zonohedra, each set of parallel edges can be varied independently.  In this array of cells, various lengths are used, and symmetry of the whole is maintained. Two cells of different composition are shown apart from the array, "pulled out" from their locations.
