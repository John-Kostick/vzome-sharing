  This is a series showing Great Circles in Octahedral and Icosahedral symmetries. Circles are indicated by vertices of 60-gons. This first model corresponds to the explanation offered in this article:

  Originally this model was made by David Hall, titled Three-60gons-in-30gon-field. In response to a query about a related construction someone had posted elsewhere, David devised a method for reflecting one of these 60-gons and copying it so as to intruduce Icosahedral Symmetry and Octahedral Symmetry in 30-gon field. This method linspired me to build a series of models with great circles that correspond to structures I had previously made from wire. In these physical models, planes are composed of circles, woven together symmetrically so that there is structural integrity.  These are not rigid, but flexible and, depending on certain parameters of construction, transformable art objects that display symmetry.  Originals of these date from late 1960s.
