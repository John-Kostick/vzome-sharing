This is a stellation of an Enneacontahedron. It is composed of three distinct stellations, one with five-fold points, a second with three-fold, and a third with two-fold.  It uses both types of faces of the polyhedron, extended to meet at points.  Connecting points can yeild all of the Platonic Solids, and Rhombic Dodecahedron and Triacontahedron as well.
