This is a construction of 3 woven interlinked planes with a 3-axis bronze star.

In response to a query about a related construction someone had posted elsewhere, David Hall devised a method for reflecting one of these 60-gons and copying it so as to construct icosahedrally symmetric arrays in 30-gon field.  Using the new version of vZome Online Viewer that Scott Vorthmann had just released, I was able to follow the history of David's construction and find key steps in the process, which led to making this model, showing six 60-gons indicating great circles, with the correponding six axes.

By the same method, this model was generated, with 10 60-gons indicating great circles. Note that all of these models show the x,y,z coordinate axes, for orientation.

What can be seen as a subset of the 10 circles above is this. Four 60-gons in octahedral symmetry, with their corresponding Body Centered Cubic axes.

This is the original 3 60-gons copied by reflection to the 5 sets of 3, indicating 15 great circles. On desktop, there are several titled Bookmarks which show all Platonic polyhedra, inscribed into the sphere indicated by the 15 60-gons.  One also shows a true Geodesic!  Note that the vertices of Icosahedron and Dodecahedron are color coded to match red and yellow axes (orbits.) In all these models,the orbit struts are adjusted to be the same length, as radii of a sphere. Note also that while all the Platonic solids are represented, not all possible orientations of them are.  There are, for example, 5 ways to orient a cube in icosahedral symmetry.  Note that there are 2 Bookmarks for tetrahedra inscribed in the cube, both together making a stellated octahedron.

Combining Six and Ten into 16 planar model.
