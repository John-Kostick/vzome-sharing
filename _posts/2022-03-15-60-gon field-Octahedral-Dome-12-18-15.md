  Various ways that domes can be constructed.  [Geodesic Domes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geodesic_dome) are mostly defined and/or built with icosahedral symmetry.  They can be seen as a subdivision of icosahedron, like this.

  However, by a more general definiotion of [geodesic](https://www.lexico.com/en/definition/geodesic), octahedral symmetry is valid.  Given that anything constructed of straight line edges and flat panels can have all vertices lying on a spherical or other curving surface, this model is geodesic in octahedral symmetry, which is to say, arcs passing through sets of vertices that, in this case, are equidistant from a center point fulfill the definition.

Many domes have been built in history, with spherical form, typically with a polar axis, similar to this.

While many are grand scale, construction of smaller scale domeed roofs has been widely practiced since antiquity.  This is a parabolic form, with the ections of the curve that intersect the cube frame representing outlines of squinches, or structures that carry support from walls to the circular base  of the dome.  [Hassan Fathy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hassan_Fathy) used traditional mud block construction of domes and vaulted roofs.
