  Various ways that domes can be constructed. While I, like many others, found Geodesic Domes inspiring, I began to look for other forms of dome structure.  [Geodesic Domes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geodesic_dome) are mostly defined and/or built with icosahedral symmetry.  However, by a more general definiotion of [geodesic](https://www.lexico.com/en/definition/geodesic), octahedral symmetry is valid.  Given that anything constructed of straight line edges and flat panels can have all vertices lying on a spherical or other curving surface, this model is geodesic in octahedral symmetry, which is to say, arcs passing through sets of vertices that, in this case, are equidistant from a center point fulfil the definition.
