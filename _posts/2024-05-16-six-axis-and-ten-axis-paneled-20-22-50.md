{% endcomment %} This is about 30 rod configurations. 30 rods can be symmetrically arranged as six sets of five rods in parallel, delineating pentagonaal prisms, and also as the ten sets of three rods in parallel, delineating triangular prisms.  These prism arrangements can be elongated so the rods act as composite beams, intersecting symmetrically.  Thus we refer to them as Six axis and Ten axis intersections.  This has been described [elsewhere](https://john-kostick.github.io/vzome-sharing/2022/04/24/Multi-axis-composite-beams-12-42-28.html).  Here the focus is on rods that do not extend much past the core "interaction sphere," where the rods are in contact with adjacents, and are understood to have some bonding where the contacts occur.  

Six axis and Ten axis intersections are both chiral forms, and here we refer to these as right handed, Rh, and left handed, Lh.  Scenes shows combinations of Six axis and Ten axis,and also a planar six pentagon interlink for reference.  Combinations are referred to as 16-axis. Notations such as "16 axis Lh-Rh" refer to a Left-handed Six axis combined with a Right-handed Ten axis. Note that these combinations, which can be physically constructed with round rods, are shown here as prisms with profiles that are tailored to fit the openings they pass through, with faces contacting faces of adjacent rods.  An image of a glass rod 16-axis construction corresponding to the scene titled "16 axis Lh-Lh fivefold view" is shown below.

One thing to observe is that rods are not the same size for the Six axis and the Ten axis to fit together.  With round rods, we have found that the "best fit" is in a range, where the ratio of rod diameter of ten axis part to rod diameter of six axis part is between 5:6 and 7:9.  The glass star shown uses 5mm and 6mm glass rods. Metal stars such as this use various ratios of wire thickness.

Looking at the scene titled "16 axis Lh-Lh fivefold view," you can see the positions of the pentagonal shaped rods, or sticks, as they pass through the combination.  

Note that in the last Scene, titled "10-axis Rh Solo, 3-fold view," the profile of the sticks is different than the others, as it is tailored to fit the openings when there is no combination with a six axis, so is called "Solo."
