This shows a sequence of 120-hedra that can be seen as a transformation. This part of the sequence is between an Icosahedron and an Enneacontahedron, shown as a composite of polyhedra edge frames, sharing 3-fold vertices. Scenes shows the transition from one to the next. While this transformation is understood to be continuous, here we only show examples that can be readily constructed with vZome.
 
vZome usera note that this sequence uses strut directions from the short leg of the Build Triangle.

A continuation of this study can be seen at [120 hedra Part 2](https://john-kostick.github.io/vzome-sharing/2024/03/27/120-Hedra-Part-2-13-05-14.html)
