  20 Regular Tetrahedra arranged around a center. There are 5 groups of 4, each group having all members congruent.

Note that these terahedra are spaced slightly apart from their nearest neighbors, so that the faces, while parallel, are not coplanar.  This is due to their vertices closest to the center not sharing an origin point, but rather coinciding with vertices of a small dodecahedron. 

Scenes shows these same tetrahedra in an exploded view, with all members moved out a certain distance further from the center. This distance is chosen so that the tetrahedra are spaced apart by green struts of the same length as their edges. 

Also shown is the resulting form paneled to become what we call a [Quintetra](http://www.kosticks.com/quintetra.html)

The convex hull of this, without the tetrahedral "dimples," has also been called a [Green Giant](http://www.georgehart.com/zomebook/green-giant.html)

This form has some unusual zonal properties, more of which are shown [Here](https://skfb.ly/6G9ZV)

Below is a related model, in which 20 tetrahedra are built out from into 20 Oct-Tet arrays, which do not overlap each other.  As with the 20 tetrahedra, there are 5 sets of 4 arrays, color matched.
