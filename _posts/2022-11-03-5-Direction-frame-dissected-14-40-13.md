This shows a five-directional space frame with section planes. There is a polar axis that is normal to all the section planes. The whole frame is dissected into 2 types of rhomb, one more prolate the other more oblate.  One of each are shown as pulled out from the array, with  planes intersecting them as triangles of 2 types.  These are so-called Robinson triangles, that compose one type of [Penrose Tiling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Penrose_tiling)  There is a one to one correspondence between rhombs in the dissection and triangles in the tiling. Thus this array, composed of 2 types of cell, can be seen as aperiodic tiling of space.
