  A model of a 5-tetrahedron interlink, where the edges of each tetrahedron do not intersect, but pass by each other, ideally in contact. Note that this composition has 20 small "bypass" tetrahedra.

Constructed in glass, this demonstrates that the cylindrical rods pass by each other in contact at tangent points.
