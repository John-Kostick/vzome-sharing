 Certain [zonohedra](https://www.georgehart.com/virtual-polyhedra/zonohedra-info.html) surrounded by sets of parallel prisms.  These align with and extend the planes of the faces of the zonohedra. The profile of these sticks, or blocks, is determined in part or completely by adjacent sticks.  The portions of the sticks that extend beyond the contained zonohedron, in this case a cube, can be cut in various ways.  In this example, the sticks have a cross-section of 1:2 proportion, and are cut to meet the faces of a Truncated Octahedron.  The assembly is shown "exploded." This construction is one of the type described in [Three-axis coordinate compositions](https://john-kostick.github.io/vzome-sharing/2022/02/25/6-strut-tensegrity-16-24-45.html)

A cube, and more generally any zonohedron, can have its zones varied independently.  Thus, a cube can have one dimension reduced.  Here is an example of the same arrangement as the above, but with the cube reduced in height.

These sets of parallel sticks, or blocks, can be defined in more than one way.  One can start with rods, either in tensegrity models, or as edges of polyhedra, as explained in [Transformation of edges of polyhedra](https://john-kostick.github.io/vzome-sharing/2022/03/01/6-strut-tensegrity-13-10-58.html)  Once rods are aligned as parralel beams with center lines that correspond to symmetry axes, the cross-section profile of the rods can be expanded to fill out the space defined by the adjacent rods in the configuration.  Another approach is to start with a zonohedron, and extend its face planes to define the prismatic profile of the sticks.  Either way, the result is like this example of a four axis intersection.  Here, a Rhombic Dodecahedron is the zonohedron surrounded by 4 beams composed of 3 sticks each, with equilateral triangular cross-section.

These arrays of sticks, or blocks surrounding zonohedra correspond directly to[ Multi-axis composite beams](https://github.com/John-Kostick/vzome-sharing/blob/main/_posts/2022-04-24-Multi-axis-composite-beams-12-42-28.md)
Here is a 4 beam intersection, which we call a Tetraxis, in exploded view, and in complete form.
