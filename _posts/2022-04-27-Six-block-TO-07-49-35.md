 Certain [zonohedra](https://www.georgehart.com/virtual-polyhedra/zonohedra-info.html) surrounded by sets of parallel prisms.  These align with and extend the planes of the faces of the zonohedra. The profile of these sticks, or blocks, is determined in part or completely by adjacent sticks.  The portions of the sticks that extend beyond the contained zonohedron, in this case a cube, can be cut in various ways.  In this example, the sticks have a cross-section of 1:2 proportion, and are cut to meet the faces of a Truncated Octahedron.  The assembly is shown "exploded." This construction is one of the type described in [Three-axis coordinate compositions](https://john-kostick.github.io/vzome-sharing/2022/02/25/6-strut-tensegrity-16-24-45.html)

A cube, and more generally any zonohedron, can have its zones varied independently.  Thus, a cube can have one dimension reduced.  Here is an example of the same arrangement as the above, but with the cube reduced in height.
