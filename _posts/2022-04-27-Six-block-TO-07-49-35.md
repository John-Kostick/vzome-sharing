 Certain [zonohedra](https://www.georgehart.com/virtual-polyhedra/zonohedra-info.html) surrounded by sets of parallel prisms.  These align with and extend the planes of the faces of the zonohedra. The profile of these sticks, or blocks, is determined in part or completely by adjacent sticks.  The portions of the sticks that extend beyond the contained zonohedron, in this case a cube, can be cut in various ways.  In this example, the sticks have a cross-section of 1:2 proportion, and are cut to meet the faces of a Truncated Octahedron.  The assembly is shown "exploded." This construction is one of the type described in [Three-axis coordinate compositions](https://john-kostick.github.io/vzome-sharing/2022/02/25/6-strut-tensegrity-16-24-45.html)

A cube, and more generally any zonohedron, can have its zones varied independently.  Thus, a cube can have one dimension reduced.  Here is an example of the same arrangement as the above, but with the cube reduced in height.

These sets of parallel sticks, or blocks, can be defined in more than one way.  One can start with rods, either in tensegrity models, or as edges of polyhedra, as explained in [Transformation of edges of polyhedra](https://john-kostick.github.io/vzome-sharing/2022/03/01/6-strut-tensegrity-13-10-58.html).  Once rods are aligned as parallel beams with center lines that correspond to symmetry axes, the cross-section profile of the rods can be expanded to fill out the space defined by the adjacent rods in the array.  Another approach is to start with a zonohedron, and extend its face planes to define the prismatic profile of the sticks.  Either way, the result is like this example of a four axis intersection.  Here, a Rhombic Dodecahedron is the zonohedron surrounded by 4 beams composed of 3 sticks each, with equilateral triangular cross-section.

These arrays of sticks, or blocks surrounding zonohedra correspond directly to[ Multi-axis composite beams](https://github.com/John-Kostick/vzome-sharing/blob/main/_posts/2022-04-24-Multi-axis-composite-beams-12-42-28.md).
Here is a 4 beam intersection, which we call a Tetraxis, in exploded view, and in complete form.

Building these forms starting with sticks and string or elastic bands led to an understanding of them as mutable entities, where the symmetries and geometric features are realized by the physical interaction of tension and compression elements.  Thus, we developed flexible, even foldable versions of these arrays. This variability of form can be expressed by models like this, where the surrounded zonohedron is an affine Rhombic Dodecahedron, and the 4 beams surrounding it have isosceles triangular profiles.  Here is shown this variation of Tetraxis in exploded view, and as complete.

As with the 4-beam models, this shows a six-beam composition as sticks with heart lines.

This shows a Rhombic Triacontahedron with one of the 30 sticks that surround it.

The stick profile in this series is isosceles triangular.  There are several ways to make the end cuts.  This is what we call Rosette cut.

Here we have an Enneacontahedron, which is a 10-directional zonohedron.  It has 2 kinds of faces, and thus 2 kinds of sticks to enclose it, each with different profiles.  This shows a sample of the 2 types of stick.

One aspect of this construction that is distinct fro the 3, 4, and 6 axis arrays is, while it takes 90 sticks to completely surround the polyhedron, the 60 wider type do not pass completely by each other beyond the zone as shown, but partially collide, or intersect further out from the interaction zone.  However, there is a set of sticks that correspond directly to the 10 beams of three struts each previously defined.  These can pass by each other without interruption.  Here is this set of sticks, which have a profile that can be described as a truncated kite.  Within the stick model and oriented to align with it is shown a representation of a tensegrity model, which shows a 1:1 correspondence between its 30 yellow struts and the 30 sticks.

Here is this set of 30 sticks magnetically connected and combined with a six-axis assembly, also magnetically connected.

Another zonohedron that can be enclosed with shaped sticks is a Rhombic Icosahedron, which has polar symmetry. Like the Enneacon, it has 2 kinds of faces, and so there are 2 kinds of sticks, which also would partially intersect each other if extended.  This variant of Rhombic Icosa is made with "normalized" 5 direction sytem, so has 10 square faces and ten rhombic.  Here is shown the RI with 4 sticks surrounding it.  Sticks have right triangular profile, at 2 different scales for the 2 types.

Other zonohedra can be surrounded with sticks, but for those with more than 2 types of faces, the process becomes more complex.

Some of the forms shown here, or variations of them, have also been explored by others, and used extensively in puzzle designs, notably by [Stewart Coffin](https://johnrausch.com/PuzzleWorld/des/sc000.htm)
