 Certain [zonohedra](https://www.georgehart.com/virtual-polyhedra/zonohedra-info.html) surrounded by sets of parallel prisms.  These align with and extend the planes of the faces of the zonohedra. The profile of these sticks, or blocks, is determined in part or completely by adjacent sticks.  Ends of sticks can be cut in various ways.  In the first example, the sticks have a cross-section of 1:2 proportion, and are cut to meet the faces of a Truncated Octahedron.  The assembly is shown "exploded." This construction is one of the type described in [Three-axis coordinate compositions](https://john-kostick.github.io/vzome-sharing/2022/02/25/6-strut-tensegrity-16-24-45.html)
