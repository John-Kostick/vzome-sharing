This is a continuation of a study of polyhedra that can represent [Close-packing of equal spheres](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Close-packing_of_equal_spheres) Part 1 of this study can be seen [Here](https://john-kostick.github.io/vzome-sharing/2022/05/19/Octagonal-Trackball-FCCvZome-18-55-02.html)  
Here, a regular Truncated Octahedron has a polyhedron inscribed in it that can be seen as representing a sphere, as its' vertices are all equidistant from the center.  Looking at the TO, rather than the familiar "Honeycomb" of packed cells, sharing faces, here we are constructing arrays by edge bonding.  In "Scenes," the first model shows 12 TO units surrounding one, sharing edges. The inscribed polyhedra, which have vertices that coincide with midpoints of the shared edges, are thus representing sheres in an FCC packing array.  The second model in "Scenes" shows an extended FCC array of these 96-hedra without the TO framework.  The third model shows that these polyhedra have the requisite vertices to also compose HCP arrays.
