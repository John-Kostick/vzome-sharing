This is a continuation of a study of polyhedra that can represent [Close-packing of equal spheres](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Close-packing_of_equal_spheres) Part 1 of this study can be seen [Here](https://john-kostick.github.io/vzome-sharing/2022/05/19/Octagonal-Trackball-FCCvZome-18-55-02.html)  
Here, a regular Truncated Octahedron has a polyhedron inscribed in it that can be seen as representing a sphere, as its' vertices are all equidistant from the center.  Looking at the TO, rather than the familiar "Honeycomb" of packed cells, sharing faces, here we are constructing arrays by sharing edges.  In "Scenes," the first model shows an FCC array, the second, an HCP array. It can be seen that in both cases, the framework of TO units sharing edges places the polyhedra in these close-packed arrays,sharing only vertices.
