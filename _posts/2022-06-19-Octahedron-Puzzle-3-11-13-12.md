  A coordinated motion puzzle. Six identical sub assemblies slide together to form an Octahedron.  All pieces that compose sub assemblies are made from stock with triangular cross section. Triangles are isoscelese with ratio of altitude to base = âˆš2/2.

A 3D design created in vZome.  Use your mouse or touch to interact.
