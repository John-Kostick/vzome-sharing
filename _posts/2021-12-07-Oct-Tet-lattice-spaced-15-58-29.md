This is a sample of an Oct-Tet lattice with separation between it's polyhedra by bands of struts that are parallel with edges of Rhombic Dodecahedra.

This can be seen as an array of Rhombic Dodecahedra with a network of Octahedra and Tetrahedra between them.  Panelling only rectangles with yellow and green edges leaves two sets of tunnels that connect the RDs to each other, and the Oct-Tet network separately.

 A modulated version of double honeycomb. Green strut Oct-Tet system is taken as an independent variable zone.

A sample of diamond lattice constructed with composite triangular struts. Octahedra and Tetrahedra serve as hubs.
