  Showing dissection of a Rhombic Icosahedron. To the right are two types of hexahedron, a prolate, wedge shape, and an oblate, lozenge shape.  To the left is an eccentric rhombic dodecahedron, which is composed of two of each type of hexahedron.  A Rhombic Icosahedron can be dissected into five of each type. There is a canonic RI, which has all golden rhombus faces, and any number of other variants with 2 types of rhombic. faces.  This pattern of dissection applies to all.  Several of the variants of RI that can be constructed with vZome are incorporated in this model as a [Sequence](https://skfb.ly/6YOIS)

This shows five directions as lines from vertices through the center of a pentagonal antiprism.  In this form, the height of the pyramids are set so that non-adjacent radial lines are at right angles.  In this angular arrangement, adjacent radial lines meet at ArcSin 1/‚àöùúë = 51.827...¬∞

Using the five directions of struts defined this way as a coordinate system, a Rhombic Icosahedron can be constructed from a polar vertex, where all five intersect. An interesting feature of this variant of RI,  which can be called normalized, is that the face angles also appear as dihedral angles. Two Rhombic Icosas can be connected at a shared polar vertex, and 10 of the wedge type of hexahedra can share the same vertex.  This array is constructed in this way, with 5 RI cells nested in, sharing some faces with one of the central RIs, and some hexahedra, and sharing edges with each other as they as they compose a ring. Fromn this arrangement, there are a couple of ways to build out with selected polyhedra from the dissection of the RI.
