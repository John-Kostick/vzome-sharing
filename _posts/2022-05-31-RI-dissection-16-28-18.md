  Showing dissection of a Rhombic Icosahedron. To the right are two types of hexahedron, a prolate, wedge shape, and an oblate, lozenge shape.  To the left is an eccentric rhombic odecahedron, which is composed of two of each type of hexahedron.  A Rhombic Icosahedron can be dissected into five of each type.

This shows a five directions as lines from vertices through the center of a pentagonal antiprism.  In this form, the height of the pyramids are set so that non-adjacent radial lines are at right angles.

Using the five directions of struts defined this way as a coordinate system, a Rhombic Icosahedron can be constructed from a polar vertex, where all five intersect.  Two Rhombic Icosas can be connectewd at a shared polar vertex, and 10 of the wedge type of hexahedra can share the same vertex.  This array is constructed in this way, with 5 RI cells nested in, sharing some faces and sharing edges as they copose a ring.
