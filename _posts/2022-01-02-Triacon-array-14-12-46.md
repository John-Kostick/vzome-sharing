Showing an array of Rhombic Triacontahedra. Rhombic Triacons, RTs,  are shown with only one set of six faces paneled in [Tetrahedral symmetry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tetrahedral_symmetry) The six faces correspond with faces of a cube.  Scenes depict how Triacontahedra can be joined to adjacents sharing these paneled faces.  In this arrangement, there are spaces between RT units that can be described as concave RTs, which as shown are also paneled in Tetrahedral symmetry. Arrays built this way are shown with faces of convex RTs in white, and faces of concave RTs in black. The last scene is an array with the struts that are not edges of panels absent, and thus is a construction of only rhombic planes that frame both convex and concave RTs.
