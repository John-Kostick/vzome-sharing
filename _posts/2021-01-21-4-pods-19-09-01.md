  A group of zonohedra extending from a common origin point. Four pod shaped zonohedra are oriented in tetrahedral symmetry. These can be seen as polar zonohedra with additional zonal bands that do not coincide with polar vertices.  In all, there are 24 directions in this array, (or 48 vectors.)  These lavender directions are taken from a set of 30 in icosahedral symmetry.  Note that there are 4 hexahedra in the opposite tetrahedral orientation.
