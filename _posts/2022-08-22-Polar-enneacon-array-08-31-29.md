 Here are examples of related arrays of polar zonohedra. These all share characteristics of arrays that can be built from even number directional systems. Major polar zonohedra use all n directions, and these major cells can be connected to others at shared polar vertices, like strings of beads.  They can also be connected in chains that surround polar axes. This can be done in 2 ways, which lead to 2 types of array.  In Type I, chains are formed by cells sharing faces with adjacents, in Type II, by shared vertices.

In Fig. 1, spaces between origin centered major cell and a ring od 10 major cells can be bridged with minor cells, composed from unit length edges that are parallel with some of the original directions. This is typical of all arrays shown here.  In this case, these are rhombic hexahedra, doedecahedra, and icosahedra.  In this, Type I array, centers of the 10 major cells that compose the ring are coplanar with the origin at the center of a major cell.  Overall symmetry of the array can continue the symmetries of the original cell, such as n-fold rotational symmetry, and n planes of reflection symmetry that intersect the polar axis. This array does not have a plane of reflection through the origin with polar axis normal to it, as the major cell does, but it could.
